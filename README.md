# Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay Character Generator

This is a small Electron app for generating characters for the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying Game, 2nd Edition.

Developed in TypeScript with React, in Electron, using NPM for package management.

To run it, you need to have NPM installed. Then clone the repo, and install all the NPM dependencies with

```
npm install
```

And finally you can start the Electron app in development mode with

```
npm start
```

Currently in early stages of development, and not yet complete enough to be useful, so there is no compiled app available for download. Also not accepting contributions until either this project reaches a basic level of completeness where you're not likely to step on my toes, or I lose interest in working on it. In either case, I'll update this README to reflect that fact.
